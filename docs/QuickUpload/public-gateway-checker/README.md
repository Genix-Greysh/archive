# public-gateway-checker
> Checks which public gateways are online or not

A small little utility website for checking if some public gateways are still up and running.

NOTE: All of these (except gateway.ipfs.io and ipfs.io) are hosted by third-parties and should be treated as such.

You can view the website via Github Pages: https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/
